Numbers API to get facts about numbers

Basically, this is just a simple app to help me learn about using APIs. 
You input a number and click go to get a random fact about a number.
You can also click the random button and then go to get a fact about a randomly selected number between 0 and 999.

Again, this is more about API practice, and I suppose also practice using styled components and framer motion animations.
